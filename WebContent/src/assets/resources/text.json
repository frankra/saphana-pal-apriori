	"apriori":"The Apriori Algorithm \n\n Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis. \n\n This experiment uses the Twitter Search API to load tweets based on the search criteria input below. Once the tweets are loaded, you can trigger the APRIORI algorithm and see the rules that were found based on the grouping of hashtags (#)."
